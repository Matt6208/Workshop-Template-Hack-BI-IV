#Making Your Own Workshop
1. Create a new repo under the HackBI GitHub organization: go to https://github.com/HackBI/ and press "New"
If you're updating an old workshop for a newer HackBI, you can use the GitHub repo for the old one. Make sure you don't mess with the commit history of the old workshop so it's possible to go back and look at it.
2. For your description, make sure to include which HackBI it's for (III, IV, etc.). If you're making changes to an older workshop for a newer HackBI, you can change the description to match.
3. Clone the GitHub repo you create to your computer.
4. Copy the README.md file, and remove all of the text specific to this example workshop. You should still have "Get Started", "Uses", "Purpose", "Goal", "Challenges", and "Resources for Further Learning". A few things about the writeup:
The writeup, the README.md file, should not be step-by-step instructions for how to follow along in the workshop, but rather a summary of the workshop. You can include steps on how to do the workshop in their own .md files, like this one.
Your writeup should be able to be printed and still be helpful. For example, don't do this, you can't tell what the link is when it's printed out.
Try to have good GitHub practices with your workshop repo. Try to keep everything you write as one commit.
Keep it looking good ðŸ˜ƒ
