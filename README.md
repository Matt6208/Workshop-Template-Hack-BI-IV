Talk about what your workshop topic is used for. What does it do?

## Purpose

## Challenges
1. List of challenges you want people in your workshop to accomplish
2. Goal of workshop broken down into more concrete steps

## Cheat Sheets
Only put this if your workshop needs it. Put syntax here or easy code to use as an example. Maybe a list of basic commands.

## More Stuff
Feel free to add a couple more of these, like "How to set up Python on a Mac" or something like that. Keep in mind that this workshop writeup should be brief and shouldn't have more information on it than your workshop presents.
